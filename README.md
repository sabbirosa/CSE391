CSE 391: Programming for the Internet
Assignment 1: Creating a Web Page
For your first assignment, you have to create your own home page that will be placed on the
Web. In addition to telling the world about you, your home page will serve as a central
repository of Web-based applications that you develop over the semester.
Deadline: As per Lab instructor
The layout and content of your Web page are entirely up to you. You are encouraged to be
creative and produce a document that you are proud to display to the world. Mainly focus page
design with full CSS. At a bare minimum, your page must provide the following:

Part 1 (35 points)
 Your page should have at least two different parts, one containing some personal information
(like your name, where you're from, etc.), and another set of links. You should include both
internal links (that jump to locations within the info page) and external links that would lead to
other pages on the web (like something related to one of your hobbies, etc).
 Your info page must have your name prominently centered at the top.
 There should be several sections to the info page (e.g., Personal Info, Hobbies, Favorite Links),
each with its own heading. At least one section must have multiple paragraphs in it.

Part 2 (15 points)
 Your info page should perform some text formatting (bold, italics, color, BIG) but try not to
overdue it to the point that the content is compromised.
 You should include a favorite quote, e.g., a poem or line from a movie.
 There should be at least one list (e.g., your top-ten favorite CDs).
 There should be at least 5 links in the page, including a link to the BRAC University and to the
CSE 391 Piazza page. At least one of those links must occur in a sentence.
Part 3 (25 points)
 There should be at least 2 images in the page, one of which must be stored locally along with
the Web page.
 There must be at least one table, some of whose rows are more than one line long.
 The page's location and last modification date should be automatically displayed at the bottom.
(Use JavaScript here.)
 Your page must make use of a style sheet that defines basic formatting style, including the
format of tables. The style sheet should be defined in a separate file and linked to your page.
You can also use some inline directives for a few of the simple styles (like making bold-faced
text).
Important note: Your page should use standard HTML (and CSS) features only, so that it will
be viewable using either Internet Explorer, Netscape (Firefox), Safari, etc. While it may not look
exactly the same due to inconsistencies and variations in the browser implementations, your page
should look reasonable under any such browser.
Part 4 (25 points)
Your homepage should have a nice (professional) look and its code should satisfy common
standards. In particular, for maximum points here, your webpage should satisfy the Strict
XHTML 1.0 (or 1.1) standards (including a proper Document Type Declaration in the HTML
file). You should pass it through tidy and validator (links are below). Please contact me for such
evaluation only if it is needed.
